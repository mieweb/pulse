Subject: Re: Request for CPT Documentation for Thesis Work

Hello Dr. Coronado,

I have received the updated offer letter from MIE with the revised job description, updated dates, and full-time position status. Attached please find:
- My updated offer letter from MIE
- My CPT form for your review and approval

The offer letter now reflects the specific job description related to my work on the Pulse platform, which aligns with my thesis research as described in my previous email.

Thank you for your continued support. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Best regards,
Priyam More
