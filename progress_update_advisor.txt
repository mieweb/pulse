Subject: Progress Update - CITI Training and IRB Application

Hello [Advisor Name],

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to provide a brief progress update on my thesis work.

**Current Status:**
- **CITI Training**: I am almost done with the CITI training and should complete it shortly.
- **IRB Application**: I am currently working on the IRB application for the user study with MIE employees.
- **Thesis Plan**: I am continuing to work through the thesis plan, focusing on the data collection infrastructure and writing components.

I will keep you updated as I complete the CITI training and submit the IRB application. Please let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything specific you'd like me to prioritize.

Thank you for your continued guidance and support.

Best regards,
Priyam More
