## * Short title

**Paste this (used in forms and correspondence):**

PulseVault MIE User Study

**Alternative:** PulseVault Adoption & Effectiveness Study

## * Brief description

**Paste this version (comprehensive; use when the form allows ~600–800 characters):**

This study evaluates the adoption and effectiveness of PulseVault, a video-based knowledge-sharing platform, when used by employees at Medical Informatics Engineering, Inc. (MIE), in their normal work context. The work is conducted as Master's thesis research at Purdue University Fort Wayne. Design: longitudinal living-labs case study with mixed methods (quantitative usage and surveys; optional qualitative interviews). Participants use PulseVault for at least one month for technical documentation, knowledge transfer, and training. Data include automated usage metrics (uploads, views, watch time, sharing), the System Usability Scale (SUS), satisfaction and adoption-barrier surveys, and optional semi-structured interviews. The study addresses how institutional users adopt video-first knowledge-sharing tools (RQ3) and how video documentation compares to text-based documentation (RQ1). No clinical or HIPAA-covered data are collected. Purdue Fort Wayne is the sole institution conducting the research; MIE is the recruitment and deployment site. Minimal risk; voluntary participation; informed consent required before any study procedures.

**Medium length (~400 characters) if the form is restrictive:**

Longitudinal user study of PulseVault (video-based knowledge-sharing platform) at Medical Informatics Engineering, Inc. (MIE). Mixed methods: usage logs, SUS and satisfaction surveys, optional interviews. Addresses adoption of video-first knowledge sharing (RQ3) and comparison to text documentation (RQ1). Single-site; PFW IRB of record; minimal risk; no clinical data. Master's thesis research at Purdue University Fort Wayne.

**Short version (~250 characters) for tight limits:**

PulseVault adoption and effectiveness study at MIE. Mixed methods: usage data, SUS/satisfaction surveys, optional interviews. Supports thesis RQ1 (video vs. text) and RQ3 (user adoption). Single-site, PFW; minimal risk; consent required.
