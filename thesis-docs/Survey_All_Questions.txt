================================================================================
SUS SCORING REMINDER
================================================================================
Odd items (1,3,5,7,9): contribution = (response – 1). Even items (2,4,6,8,10):
contribution = (5 – response). Sum all 10 contributions, multiply by 2.5 =
SUS score (0–100). Replace "this system" with "PulseVault" in the form if
you prefer.
