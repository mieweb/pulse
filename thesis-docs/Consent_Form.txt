Study title: Adoption and Effectiveness of PulseVault for Institutional
             Knowledge Sharing: A Longitudinal User Study with Medical
             Informatics Engineering Employees

Principal Investigator: Priyam More, Purdue University Fort Wayne
Faculty Advisor: Romael Haque, Purdue University Fort Wayne
IRB of Record: Purdue University Fort Wayne
[IRB approval number: _____________ if required]


----------------------------------------------------------------------
INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You are invited to take part in a research study. This study is part of
graduate thesis research at Purdue University Fort Wayne. We want to learn
how employees at Medical Informatics Engineering, Inc. (MIE) use PulseVault
— a video-based knowledge-sharing platform — and how it compares to
text-based documentation.

The purpose is to understand adoption, usability, and whether video
documentation is helpful in your workflow. Your participation is voluntary.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT WILL I DO IF I TAKE PART?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
If you agree to take part, you will:

1. Use PulseVault as you normally would for work (upload, view, share
   short videos) for at least one month. There are no required tasks or
   minimum usage.

2. Complete up to three short online surveys:
   - Baseline (after you consent): about your role and past use of video
     for documentation (~3–5 min)
   - Midpoint (~2 weeks in): questions about PulseVault usability and
     satisfaction (~5–8 min)
   - End of study (~1 month): usability, satisfaction, and questions
     about video vs. text documentation (~8–12 min)

3. Optionally, take part in a one-on-one interview (about 30–60 minutes)
   to discuss your experience. If you do, we will ask separately for
   permission to record the conversation.

4. Allow the study team to use your PulseVault usage data (e.g. uploads,
   views) for research. This data is already generated when you use the
   platform; we will use it in anonymized or aggregated form in the thesis.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
RISKS AND DISCOMFORT
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We do not expect any significant risks. The activities are similar to
normal use of PulseVault and answering short surveys. Possible minor
burdens include the time needed for surveys (~5–15 minutes each) and, if
you choose, one interview (~30–60 minutes). You may skip any question or
withdraw at any time.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
BENEFITS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
There may be no direct benefit to you. Possible benefits include:
- Using PulseVault for work-related knowledge sharing
- Helping MIE and the research team understand how video documentation
  works in practice
- Informing future improvements to the platform



----------------------------------------------------------------------
CONFIDENTIALITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Your responses and usage data will be kept confidential and used only
  for this research.
- Only the research team (Principal Investigator and Faculty Advisor) will
  have access to information that can identify you.
- In the thesis and any publications, we will report only aggregated or
  anonymized results (e.g. group averages, percentages). We will not
  identify you by name or in a way that makes you recognizable.
- If you give an optional email to link your survey to your PulseVault
  use, that link is only for our analysis and will not be shared.
- Data will be stored securely and retained according to Purdue University
  Fort Wayne and IRB policies, then deleted or de-identified when no
  longer needed.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- Taking part is voluntary. You do not have to participate, and deciding
  not to participate will not affect your employment or standing at MIE.
- You may withdraw at any time. If you withdraw, we will stop collecting
  new data from you. What happens to data already collected (e.g. whether
  it is deleted or kept in anonymized form) will follow the procedures
  approved by the IRB and described when you withdraw.
- The investigators may stop your participation if they think it is in
  your best interest or for other reasons allowed by the IRB.
