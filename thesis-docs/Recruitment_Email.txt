--- EMAIL BODY ---

Hi everyone,

I’m Priyam More, a graduate student at Purdue University Fort Wayne, and I’m
working with MIE on a thesis study about **PulseVault** — the video-based
knowledge-sharing platform we’re using for procedures, training, and
documentation.

I’m inviting you to take part in a **user study** to see how PulseVault is
used in practice and how it compares to text-based documentation. Your
feedback will help improve the platform and inform my research.

**What’s involved**
- Using PulseVault as you normally would for work (upload, watch, share
  short videos) for about **1 month**
- Up to **3 short surveys** (baseline, midpoint, end) — about 5–10 minutes
  each
- Option to do a **30–60 minute interview** to talk about your experience
  (completely voluntary)

**Eligibility**
- MIE employees who are allowed to use PulseVault for work-related knowledge
  sharing
- Participation is **voluntary**. Whether you take part or not has no effect
  on your job or standing at MIE.

**What happens next**
If you’d like to participate:
1. Read the study information and consent form: [LINK_TO_CONSENT]
2. Complete the consent form (electronically or as instructed).
3. After you consent, you’ll get a short baseline survey and info on how to
   use PulseVault if you haven’t already: [LINK_TO_PULSEVAULT]

**Contacts**
- Principal Investigator: Priyam More — [your email]
- Faculty Advisor: Romael Haque — haque28@purdue.edu
- Purdue Fort Wayne IRB: [IRB office contact from PFW website]

Thank you for considering participation. Your input will help us understand
how video documentation works at MIE and how to make tools like PulseVault
more useful.

Best,
Priyam More
