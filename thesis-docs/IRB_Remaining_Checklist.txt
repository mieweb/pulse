WHAT'S REMAINING FOR IRB — CHECKLIST
================================================================================
You now have the main documents. Use this list to finish your IRB submission
and to resubmit later if IRB asks for more materials.
================================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
ALREADY DONE (you have these)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[OK] Protocol document ...................... IRB_Protocol.txt
[OK] Basic study info (title, description,
     single-site, PI, etc.) ................. IRB_SUBMISSION_FILL_IN.txt
[OK] Survey questions (baseline, midpoint,
     end; SUS + video vs. text) ............. Survey_All_Questions.txt
[OK] Recruitment email / announcement ....... Recruitment_Email.txt
[OK] Consent form (draft) ................... Consent_Form.txt
[OK] Advisor name in protocol ............... Romael Haque (done)


----------------------------------------------------------------------
BEFORE YOU SUBMIT — DO THESE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] 1. Export IRB_Protocol.txt to PDF and attach it in the IRB system
      as the required "Protocol" document.

[ ] 2. Fill in Basic Study Information using IRB_SUBMISSION_FILL_IN.txt
      (title, short title, brief description, single-site, no external
      IRB, PI = Priyam More, no financial interest, student-led = Yes).

[ ] 3. Fix Consent_Form.txt:
      - Insert [PI EMAIL] (your email).
      - Insert Purdue Fort Wayne IRB contact (phone/email from PFW
        IRB website).
      - Add [IRB approval number] and [DATE] placeholders if your IRB
        template needs them.
      - If PFW provides a consent template, copy this content into it.

[ ] 4. If the IRB system has separate upload slots for "Consent Form" or
      "Recruitment Materials," upload:
      - Consent_Form.txt (or PDF/Word version of it)
      - Recruitment_Email.txt (or a one-page recruitment script that
        uses that text)

[ ] 5. If the IRB form asks for "Data collection instruments" or
      "Surveys," upload Survey_All_Questions.txt (or a PDF/Word version)
      so they see exactly what you will ask.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IRB OFTEN ASKS FOR (and where it is)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
| IRB wants...              | Where it is                      |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Protocol                  | IRB_Protocol.txt → save as PDF  |
| Consent form              | Consent_Form.txt                |
| Recruitment script/email  | Recruitment_Email.txt           |
| Survey / instruments      | Survey_All_Questions.txt        |
| Principal Investigator    | Priyam More                     |
| Faculty Advisor           | Romael Haque, haque28@purdue.edu|
| IRB of record             | Purdue University Fort Wayne    |


----------------------------------------------------------------------
AFTER IRB APPROVAL
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[ ] Replace [LINK_TO_CONSENT] in Recruitment_Email.txt with the real link
    to your consent form (e.g. Qualtrics/Google Form or hosted PDF).

[ ] Replace [LINK_TO_PULSEVAULT] with https://pulse-vault.opensource.mieweb.org/
    (or the exact URL you give participants).

[ ] Build your 3 surveys in Google Forms (or your institution’s tool)
    using Survey_All_Questions.txt. Turn on “collect email” only if you
    need to link responses to PulseVault usage and consent allows it.

[ ] Send recruitment email (or short version) to MIE employees only
    after IRB approval and after MIE leadership is okay with it.


----------------------------------------------------------------------
IF IRB ASKS FOR MORE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
- “Debriefing form” …. Usually for studies with deception; you have none.
  You can say “Not applicable — no deception.”
- “Demographic questionnaire” …. Your baseline survey already has role
  and prior video use; add more only if IRB insists.
- “Interview guide” …. You can add a one-pager: “Topics: adoption,
  barriers, workflow fit, video vs. text, suggestions.” No need for
  scripted questions.
- “Data management plan” …. Your protocol Section 7 (Data storage,
  access, retention) covers it; point IRB there or paste that section
  into their template if they have one.

================================================================================
SUMMARY: You have protocol, consent, recruitment, and survey. The remaining
steps are (1) export protocol to PDF and attach, (2) fill in the IRB form
from the fill-in guide, (3) add your email and IRB contact to the consent
form and attach consent + recruitment + survey if the system has slots for
them. Then submit.
