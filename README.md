**Pulse** is a React Native application designed specifically for **institutional knowledge sharing** and **training documentation**. Built for organizations that need to capture, organize, and share institutional knowledge through short-form video content with enterprise-grade security and professional editing capabilities.

## üéØ Purpose & Vision

Pulse addresses the critical need for modern institutional knowledge management by providing:

- **Secure Video Documentation**: Capture institutional procedures, training materials, and knowledge transfer sessions
- **Professional Content Creation**: Advanced editing tools for creating polished institutional content
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Works seamlessly across iOS and Android devices
- **Local-First Security**: All content remains on-device until explicitly shared through secure channels

### Institutional Use Cases

- **Training Documentation**: Create step-by-step training videos for new employees
- **Process Documentation**: Record institutional procedures and workflows
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Capture expert knowledge before staff transitions
- **Compliance Training**: Develop engaging compliance and safety training materials
- **Institutional Memory**: Preserve institutional knowledge and best practices

## üöÄ Key Features

### Professional Recording & Editing

- **Segmented Recording** - Record multiple clips that combine seamlessly for comprehensive training content
- **Time Selection** - Choose from 15s, 30s, 1m, or 3m recording durations perfect for different training scenarios
- **Native Video Processing** - Hardware-accelerated video concatenation with AVFoundation for professional quality
- **Drag & Drop Reordering** - Intuitive visual reordering with real-time drop indicators for content organization
- **Undo/Redo System** - Full editing control with persistent storage across app sessions

### Institutional Security & Workflow

- **Local-First Storage** - All content remains secure on your device until explicitly shared
- **Deep Linking** - Custom `pulsecam://` URL scheme for direct app access and institutional integration
- **Draft Management** - Auto-save your work and continue later with intelligent draft system
- **Cross-Platform** - React Native with Expo for iOS and Android ensuring organization-wide compatibility
- **Real-Time Progress** - Live progress tracking and auto-save functionality for uninterrupted workflow

### Professional Controls

- **Camera Controls** - Flash, camera flip, zoom, and stabilization for professional-quality recordings
- **Video Library Integration** - Import existing videos from your gallery and mix with new recordings
- **Smart Duration Management** - Set recording limits and prevent content from exceeding institutional guidelines
- **Hardware Acceleration** - Native video processing for optimal performance on all devices

## üìö Research Context

Pulse is developed as part of ongoing research into **institutional knowledge management** and **video-based documentation systems**. The project explores:

- **Business Value Assessment**: How video documentation impacts ticket resolution time, knowledge adoption, and collaboration efficiency
- **Technical Scalability**: Challenges in scaling secure video capture, editing, and delivery for organizational use
- **User Adoption Studies**: Factors influencing adoption of video-first knowledge-sharing platforms in institutional settings

### Research Objectives

1. **Evaluate Business Value**: Compare organizational outcomes between traditional documentation and video-first approaches
2. **Design & Develop Platform**: Implement secure cross-platform mobile app with scalable backend pipeline
3. **Assess Adoption & Usability**: Conduct user studies to analyze usability, knowledge retention, and satisfaction

## üè¢ Institutional Deployment

### For Organizations

Pulse is designed for institutional deployment with the following considerations:

- **Security-First Design**: All content remains on-device until explicitly shared through secure channels
- **Compliance Ready**: Built with institutional data policies and compliance requirements in mind
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to integrate with existing institutional infrastructure
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Ensures all team members can participate regardless of device

### Future Backend Integration

Planned features for institutional deployment:

- **Cloudflare Stream Integration**: Secure video hosting and adaptive streaming
- **Institutional Authentication**: Integration with existing organizational identity systems
- **Content Management**: Centralized content library with access controls
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Usage analytics and content effectiveness metrics

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mieweb/pulse.git
cd pulse
npm install
```

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Expo CLI
- Xcode (for iOS development)
- Android Studio (for Android development)

### Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Expo development server
npx expo start

# For iOS development
npx expo prebuild
cd ios
pod install
open pulse.xcworkspace
# Build and run in Xcode

# For Android development
npx expo run:android
```

**Required Permissions:**

- Camera Access
- Microphone Access
- Storage Access

## Configuration

### Recording Settings

```typescript
const defaultSettings = {
  maxIndividualDuration: 60, // Maximum duration for a single recording segment
  holdDelay: 500, // Delay before hold recording starts (ms)
  progressUpdateInterval: 100, // Progress update frequency (ms)
};
```

### Video Stabilization

The app includes cross-platform video stabilization controls:

- **iOS**: Full range of stabilization modes (`off`, `standard`, `cinematic`, `cinematicExtended`, `auto`)
- **Android**: Simple on/off control
- **Control**: Tap to cycle modes, long-press for mode picker
- **Platform Mapping**: iOS-specific modes automatically map to "on" on Android

For detailed information, see [VIDEO_STABILIZATION.md](./VIDEO_STABILIZATION.md).

### Time Options

```typescript
const timeOptions = [
  { label: "15s", value: 15 },
  { label: "30s", value: 30 },
  { label: "1m", value: 60 },
  { label: "3m", value: 180 },
];
```

### Video Concatenation

```typescript
interface RecordingSegment {
  id: string;
  duration: number;
  uri: string;
  inMs?: number; // Optional start trim point
  outMs?: number; // Optional end trim point
}

// Usage
const outputUri = await VideoConcatModule.export(segments);
```

## Development

### CodeQL Configuration

This project includes automated CodeQL security analysis for Swift/iOS code. The CodeQL workflow is configured to build the React Native iOS project with the following settings:

- **Workspace**: `ios/pulse.xcworkspace`
- **Scheme**: `pulse`
- **SDK**: iPhone Simulator SDK
- **Configuration**: Debug build with code signing disabled

#### Updating Xcode Configuration

If you need to update the workspace name or scheme used by CodeQL:

1. **Workspace Changes**: If you rename the Xcode workspace file, update the `-workspace` parameter in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`:

   ```bash
   -workspace YourNewWorkspace.xcworkspace \
   ```

2. **Scheme Changes**: If you rename the app scheme, update the `-scheme` parameter in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml`:

   ```bash
   -scheme YourNewScheme \
   ```

3. **Target Changes**: If you add new Swift files or targets, ensure they are included in the main app scheme for CodeQL analysis.

The CodeQL analysis requires:

- CocoaPods dependencies installed (`pod install`)
- Code signing disabled (`CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO`)
- Metro bundler skipped (`RCT_NO_LAUNCH_PACKAGER=1`, `SKIP_BUNDLING=1`)
- iPhone simulator build target
