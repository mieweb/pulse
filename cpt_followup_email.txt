Subject: Re: Request for CPT Documentation for Thesis Work

Hello Dr. Coronado,

I am attaching my previous offer letter from MIE for your reference. I will be requesting an updated offer letter from MIE with new dates and full-time position status after I get a go-ahead from you.

Would you also like me to request a more specific job description in the new offer letter that details my work on the Pulse video knowledge management platform? This would include responsibilities such as building, deploying, maintaining, and fixing the platform, as well as conducting user studies for my thesis research, which would better align with the work I described in my previous email.

Please let me know if you would like the updated job description included, or if the current job description in the attached offer letter is sufficient.

Thank you for your continued support.

Best regards,
Priyam More
