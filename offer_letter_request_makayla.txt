Subject: Request for Updated Offer Letter for CPT Authorization

Hi Makayla,

I hope you're doing well. I'm reaching out to request an updated offer letter for CPT authorization. The primary requirement I need is an updated job description that is specifically required for my CPT approval in connection with my thesis. I'll also need updated dates and full-time position status.

The updated offer letter would need to reflect:
- **Work hours**: 40 hours per week
- **Spring employment dates**: January 15, 2026, to April 28, 2026
- **Updated job description**: This is the main requirement for my thesis CPT approval. The job description needs to be more specific about my work on the Pulse video knowledge management platform. Suggested job duties include:
  - Build, deploy, maintain, and fix the Pulse video knowledge management platform
  - Develop and implement new features for the platform
  - Monitor system performance and troubleshoot technical issues
  - Conduct user studies with employees and collect data for thesis research
  - Document system architecture and development processes
  - Collaborate with team members on platform improvements

The end date of April 28, 2026, aligns with my thesis completion date, which is the maximum duration for which I can receive CPT authorization. The updated job description is essential because my academic department needs to see that my work at MIE is directly related to my thesis research on the Pulse platform.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or if you'd like me to adjust the job description. I appreciate your help with this.

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Priyam More
